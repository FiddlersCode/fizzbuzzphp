# PHP Fizzbuzz
by Paula Muldoon

### About
As I am starting a job as a PHP developer, I decided to learn PHPUnit with the classic kata, FizzBuzz.

The rules are thus:
```
Lets divide this into different steps so, we can easily write and test this.
- Print numbers from 1 to 100
- Print "Fizz" instead of number which is divisible by 3
- Print "Buzz" instead of number which is divisible by 5
- Print "FizzBuzz" instead of number which is divisible by both 3 and 5
```

If you would like to contribute to this repo please feel free to make a pull request.

Happy FizzBuzz'ing
